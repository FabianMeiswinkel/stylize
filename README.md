# Stylize
Stylize is designed to simplify style enforcement by transitioning from violation detection to automatic enforcement.  It uses Roslyn (Microsoft.CodeAnalysis) to scan for and fix any potential violations in a .NET solution.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and build Stylize
2. Run bin/[Debug|Release]/Product/Stylize/Stylize.exe (see also [Sample Configuration](https://github.com/nicholjy/stylize/wiki/Sample-Configuration))

## Future Work
* MSBuild integration to run Stylize as part of the build process
* Support for other source repositories
